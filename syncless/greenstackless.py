"""This module implements the stackless API on top of py.magic greenlet API
This way it is possible to run concurrence applications on top of normal python
using the greenlet module.
Because the greenlet module uses only 'hard' switching as opposed to stackless 'soft' switching
it is a bit slower (about 35%), but very usefull because you don't need to install stackless.
Note that this does not aim to be a complete implementation of stackless on top of greenlets,
just enough of the stackless API to make concurrence run.
This code was inspired by:
http://aigamedev.com/programming-tips/round-robin-multi-tasking and
also by the pypy implementation of the same thing (buggy, not being maintained?) at
https://codespeak.net/viewvc/pypy/dist/pypy/lib/stackless.py?view=markup
